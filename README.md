## Title

CSS to Sass

## Synopsis

RWD project for the Treehouse Frontend Web Developer TechDegree

From Treehouse: "In this project you will convert a CSS stylesheet to Sass. 
"You'll refactor the stylesheet from the Build a Responsive Layout project using SCSS partials, variables, extends, and mixins."

## How you will be graded

To get a passing grade you'll need to submit a project that meets the following requirements. If your project receives a "Needs Work" rating on any of these tasks, then you'll need to edit your project and re-submit it until it "Meets" or "Exceeds" each task requirement.
